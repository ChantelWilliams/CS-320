How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by using dynamic and static testing along with structure-based testing. Software development teams use static testing to check their code for errors and bugs without having to execute it and I have found that both techniques were the most effective when working through each milestone.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by reading through the customer requirements multiple time thoroughly. When I understand what is being asked of me from the customer, I can provide a final product that will satisfy them. When programing for a client I always make sure to open their requirements into a word document and mark them of as they are completed. I have found that this method best helps me to make sure all customer requirements have been met.

How do I approach designing software?
When approaching software design, I try my best to have a clear understating of what my requirements are that way I can start thinking about all components of the project.
